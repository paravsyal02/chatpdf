# Chat with PDF using Hugging Face

This Streamlit application allows you to interact with PDF documents by asking questions and getting answers based on the content of the uploaded PDFs. The app extracts the text from the PDFs, splits it into manageable chunks, and uses Hugging Face's Question Answering pipeline to provide answers based on the content of the documents.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files.
- Ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- The app splits the text from the PDFs into smaller chunks for efficient question answering.
- Get answers to your questions from the content of the uploaded PDFs using Hugging Face's QA pipeline.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2
- langchain
- transformers
- Hugging Face API

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatpdf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd chatpdf
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. Upload the PDF files using the file uploader on the left sidebar.
2. Once the files are uploaded, you can enter a question related to the content of the PDFs in the input box.
3. The app will process the PDFs, split the content into chunks, and use Hugging Face's Question Answering model to provide relevant answers.

## How It Works

- The app uses **PyPDF2** to extract text from the PDF files.
- It splits the extracted text into smaller chunks using **langchain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.
- The **Hugging Face's question-answering pipeline** is then used to answer your questions based on the content in these chunks.
